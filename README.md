## How to Use
First - Make sure to have both npm and node.js installed (installing node should automatically install npm).  Node.js is available here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Duplicate the repository by clicking "Use this template" on the web interface (https://github.com/Dulli1419/web-dev-template) and then select "Create a new repository".  Once created clone it to your workspace to get started.

After you clone the new repository make sure to run
```
npm init
```
from terminal, wiithin the directory, to update the package.json file as is appropriate.

finally run
```
npm install
```
from terminal, within the directory, to quickly install all dependencies listed in package.json

NOTE: the .gitignore file includes a reservation for a directory called "localDev".  Create that directory as a quick place to keep all of your files that you want kept local only.

Note: the .gitignore also excludes the node_modules folder.  You may want to remove this from the .gitignore from your project but that folder will be populated by package.json when your run
```
npm install
```
so it didn't seem necessary to keep it as part of the repository in the template.
